Python 3 global error handling & self-handling exceptions.

> [!CAUTION]  
> As of 7 March 2024, this repository has been officially dropped and is **no longer supported**.
> The reasons are:
> - I do not want to deal with Python for my personnal projects.
> - I believe there's no real need for me to keep this project "as alive" when I do not plan to commit ever again.
> 
> As such, this repository will now be archived. I hope you understand this decision. If you'd like to, feel free to fork this repository, make changes, and enjoy it yourself.
>
> Aspreno has been one the way I wish I could enjoy Python in my everyday programming, but now that I notice how unsupportive the language is towards my need, I prefer just leaving.
